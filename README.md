SQL Basic Practice
===================================================

## Description

Few Basics SQL for learning purpose. I have created from my colleage days.

## Dataset
Example Datasets also present in data folder.

## Assignment
Assume you are provided with a table containing the following information:
* timestamp (e.g., “2018-01-05 13:20:10”)
* user_id (e.g., “10000133”,“50600182”)
* action_type (e.g., “purchase”,”visit”,”view”)
The table contains 3 columns for the variables, 800 rows, 50 distinct user_ids and 5 distinct action_types. 

You need to first create the Table into the DB and need to complete the following exercise:

### Question a:
Write a SQL query that allows you to find the row with the first (oldest) action in the dataset. 

### Question b:
Write a SQL query that allows you to find, for each user, the first action and the associated timestamp. 

### Question c:
Write a SQL query that allows you to compute the two day retention KPI, i.e. find the share of users that performed an action the day after their respective first action.
